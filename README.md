# Flood Detection Using Deep Learning and Satellite Imagery

This project presents a binary semantic segmentation model based on U-Net to detect flood-affected regions in satellite images. It aims to provide an automated, efficient, and scalable flood detection solution to improve early warning systems and aid in disaster response.

## Overview

Natural disaster management is often challenged by high operational costs, time delays, and manual analysis. This project addresses those issues by using deep learning for automatic flood detection from aerial imagery.

Key features:
- U-Net-based segmentation model implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Binary segmentation to classify pixels as flood or non-flood.
- Visualization of model predictions after each epoch for qualitative analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **FloodNet-Supervised_v1.0**, a public dataset consisting of annotated flood scenes captured by UAVs and satellites.

- Total images: 2343 (Train: 1445, Validation: 450, Test: 448)
- Image resolution: Varies; all images are resized to 256x256 for training.
- Each image has a corresponding semantic mask with 10 classes:
  - `0`: Background
  - `1`: Building-flooded
  - `2`: Building-non-flooded
  - `3`: Road-flooded
  - `4`: Road-non-flooded
  - `5`: Water
  - `6`: Tree
  - `7`: Vehicle
  - `8`: Pool
  - `9`: Grass

For binary flood segmentation, the following class IDs were considered as *flood*:  
`[1, 3, 5]` → Building-flooded, Road-flooded, and Water.

## Requirements

All dependencies required to run the project are listed in `requirements.txt`.

To install:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Training the Model

All training, evaluation, and visualization steps are available in the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
flood-segmentation-model.ipynb
```

- Data is loaded directly from the `FloodNet-Supervised_v1.0` folder.
- U-Net architecture is used for segmentation.
- Binary masks are generated by mapping multi-class labels `[1, 3, 5]` to class `1` (flood), and all others to `0`.

After training, sample predictions are visualized at the end of each epoch for performance monitoring.

---

## Output

- **Binary Segmentation Output**: Mask showing flooded vs. non-flooded areas.
- **Epoch-wise Visual Output**: Concatenated image showing:
  - Original image
  - Predicted flood mask
  - Mask overlay on the original image

---

## Notes

- Model weights are saved automatically after each epoch using `ModelCheckpoint`.
- Callback class `PlotLearning` shows live visual outputs during training.
- Dataset must be pre-downloaded into the same directory as the notebook.
